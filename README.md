# VacIT

VacIT is a project aimed at the development of a (small) vacancy site.

The site is mainly composed of two sections: the applicant section and the employer section. Applicants will have the opportunity to check for all available vacancies, create and edit their own profile and directly apply for the
vacancies using the 'Apply Direct' button present under each vacancy. The site also provides an overview for the applicants of all the vacancies for which they have applied. Employers can add and/or edit vacancies, edit their own profile page,
and check the profiles of the potential candidates. Using the 'Invite' button, the employer can invite applicants for a job interview. 

Applicants can registrer using the login/registration tool found on the corresponding page while employers will have to registrer via the administrator. The administrator can manage the entire site who access to all entered data. 

VacIT is part of the Educom educational programme, which promotes the hands-on learning of coding/progamming skills for junior software developers.
